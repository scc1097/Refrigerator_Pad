Refrigerator_Pad
================

this repository contains all of the code for my refrigerator pad project, including the Raspberry Pi script, and the Google App Engine website folder. My project was basically a pad which uses weight sensors to detect when items are running low in your fridge, and then it updates a grocery list on my website.
